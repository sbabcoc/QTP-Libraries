# QTP-Libraries
These VBScript libraries were written to support Quick Test Pro automated testing.

I think the most interesting chunk of code in this collection is `WebService.vbs`, which implements the following conversions:

* JSON to XML
* JSON to Object
* XML to JSON
* Object to JSON

It also contains code that demonstrates how to retrieve data from a web service, and how to use an XSD to validate an XML document.
